      How are things. My name is Dean and I am your next software engineer. Key
      software skills:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>Node.js</li>
      <li>SQL</li>
      <li>HTML & CSS</li>
      <li>Git & github</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Skills i'm working on:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Unit testing</li>
      <li>Flask experience</li>
      <li>React</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some of the things i've done professionally:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hons degree in Chemistry</li>
      <li>Built successful career in technical sales (industrial B2B)</li>
      <li>
        Travelled to 30+ countries conducting technical presentations to
        customers, plant trials and business negotiations
      </li>
      <li>Grew sales at a chemical startup from $800K to $6.5M in 4 years</li>
      <li>Exceptional soft skills with clients and partners alike</li>
      <li>
        Juggled family and work responsibilities to learn programming part time
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The best thing i've gotten from my career so far is experience. Sales is a
      tough arena and i'm proud that i've had success. While financially
      rewarding I have no passion left for full time industrial B2B. At heart, I
      want a technical occupation and to build things myself; in sales you're
      never the subject matter expert.
