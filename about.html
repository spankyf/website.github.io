    <h1>Welcome to my House</h1>

    <h2>What i'm building in here</h2>

    <p>How are things. My name is Dean and I am your next software engineer.</p>
    <p>Some of the things i've done professionally:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hons degree in Chemistry</li>
      <li>Worked in a pharmaceutical company as a QC/QA analyst</li>
      <li>Immigrated to a new country solo</li>
      <li>Built successful career in technical sales (industrial B2B)</li>
      <li>
        Travelled to 30+ countries conducting technical presentations to
        customers, plant trials and business negotiations
      </li>
      <li>Grew sales at a chemical startup from $800K to $6.5M in 4 years</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      And there's more, but i'd be bragging. The best thing i've gotten from my
      career so far is experience. Sales is a tough arena and i'm proud that i'm
      good at it. It's certainly financially rewarding... but of course that's
      not what life is about. For all the cars and bonuses, there's precious
      little passion in this career. And at heart, I want to build things
      myself; in sales you're never the subject matter expert.
    </p>

    <p>
      And so I present myself to you, dear reader as a willing knight to take up
      the tools of the software engineering trade.
    </p>
