    <h1>Welcome to my House</h1>

    <h2>Here are my projects</h2>

    <h4>Resume Builder</h4>
    <p>This is to practice my front-end skills and to learn React.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="resume.html">Here's my resume</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Working on front-end resume builder. So it doesn't look like it came
      straight out of Word.
    </p>

    <!-- second project -->
    <h4>MLS Soccer Betting</h4>
    <p>
      This is a soccer betting strategy based on 'bouncebackability'. Features

        >
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It's only fair I include a betting program in my Portfolio. I first got
      interested in programming when I moved from Excel to Python back in 2014.
      Since then I have managed to create full betting app's scraping odds,
      performing ML logistic regression and using automated betting to 'get on'
      when the lines are soft. This is very much a lite version of that but it
      shows how I got the bug. Always enjoy the challenge of going mano-a-mano
      with the bookie.
    </p>
    <!-- third project -->
    <h4>Music Practice</h4>
    <p>
      This is a music practice app made in Node and Python. It's only working
      via CLI now, I intend to get a Flask app with SPA set up.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/spankyf/soccer-betting"
          >Click here to view the git repository</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I track many habits I have and music practicing is no exception. This
      provides the right amount of randomness and repetition. Fully customizable
      for beginners to pro's comping Giant Steps in 8/13.
    </p>
    <!-- fourth project -->
    <h4>Rabbit Habit</h4>
    <p>
      This is a website I made used to track sleep habits (so only click that
      one!). It's build using:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Node.js & Express server</li>
      <li>MVC architecture</li>
      <li>Calls python via spawned process</li>
      <li>
        Basic CRUD functionality with sleep updates using Sequelize and Postgres
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://immense-sea-62601.herokuapp.com/"
          >Click here to view the app online (deployed via Heroku - give it a
          couple of minutes to fire up)</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/spankyf/rabbit-habit-two"
          >Click here to view the git repository</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This was my first project that I deployed. A lot of pride in getting it
      up. Obviously it was a great learning experience but this needs to be a
      SPA as the loading is painful.
